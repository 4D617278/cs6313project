\begin{enumerate}
\item
There is a weak positive correlation between GPA and ACT scores. 

The expected population correlation coefficient is 0.2723708 with a 95\% confidence margin of 0.2054467.
\item
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item
        The two distributions do not seem similar since the measures of central tendency are more than 2 sample standard deviations apart from each other.
        \item
        It does not appear that the manufacturing process can be established locally since the confidence interval does not contain the value 0. We assume that a confidence interval of 95\% is a sufficiently low level of significance and that the sampling distributions are normal because the sample size is greater than or equal to 30. The approximate normality of the sampling distribution was verified with qqnorm by checking that each plot is approximately linear.
        \item
        My conclusion in (b) is the same as what I expected from the exploratory analysis in (a).
    \end{enumerate}
\item
To check whether or not there is a difference between the population means, we must first check to see if the distributions for the theoretical and experimental samples are approximately normal. This is done using qqnorm and if the resulting graph is approximately linear, we assume the distribution is normal. Then, we must construct a 95\% confidence interval. We first obtain things like the sample size, standard deviation of the mean difference between the samples, and then the standard error, and degrees of freedom since we donâ€™t know the population variance and have relatively small sample size. Once we construct this confidence interval, we must determine if 0 is within the interval. If so, there is no evidence that there is a difference in mean vapor pressure between the two groups based on the samples provided.
