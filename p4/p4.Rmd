\begin{enumerate}
\item
There is a weak positive correlation between GPA and ACT scores. 

The expected population correlation coefficient is 0.2723708 with a 95\% confidence margin of 0.2054467.
\item
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item
        The two distributions do not seem similar since the measures of central tendency are more than 2 sample standard deviations apart from each other.
        \item
        It does not appear that the manufacturing process can be established locally since the confidence interval does not contain the value 0. We assume that a confidence interval of 95\% is a sufficiently low level of significance and that the sampling distributions are normal because the sample size is greater than or equal to 30. The approximate normality of the sampling distribution was verified with qqnorm by checking that each plot is approximately linear.
        \item
        My conclusion in (b) is the same as what I expected from the exploratory analysis in (a).
    \end{enumerate}
