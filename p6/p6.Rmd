\begin{enumerate}
\item
We used the forward algorithm to build a "reasonably good" linear model for the data by taking log(PSA) as the response variable. 
We used log(PSA) instead of PSA because the means of the residuals for the PSA model are not approximately 0 as the graph of the fitted and residual values shows points with values of ~150 for the residual value and there are not corresponding points with negative residual values for the same fitted value. 
The model assumptions for the log(PSA) model are approximately satisfied because the graph of fitted and residual values has a scale of about -1 to 1 and the residuals have a mean of about 0. 
The normal Q-Q plot is approximately linear and a time series plot can not be calculated to check the independence of the errors.
The predicted value of the PSA value for a patient whose quantitative predictors are at the sample means of the variables and qualitative predictors are at the most frequent category is 2.478669.

qqnorm(resid(psa_model))

# get most frequent value and column means
