        We can conclude that approximately every three out of four people are from Maine and approximately every one out of four people are not from Maine.

        Number of people not from Maine $\approx \frac{1417}{1417 + 4458} \approx \frac{1500}{6000} = \frac{1}{4}$

        Number of people from Maine $\approx \frac{4458}{1417 + 4458} \approx \frac{4500}{6000} = \frac{3}{4}$

        \item
        We can conclude that the two distributions are slightly right-skewed and their average time is around 60 minutes.

        $mean_1 - median_1 = 58.20 - 57.03 > 0$

        $mean_2 - median_2 = 57.82 - 56.92 > 0$

        $mean_1 = 58.20 \approx 60, median_1 = 57.03 \approx 60$

        $mean_2 = 57.82 \approx 60, median_2 = 56.92 \approx 60$

        \item
        We can conclude that there are outliers for the two distributions and that 75\% of times fall between about 50 and 65.

        $Q3_1 + IQR_2 * 1.5 = 64.24 + (64.24 - 50) * 1.5 = 85.6 < 152.17$

        $Q3_2 + IQR_2 * 1.5 = 64.83 + (64.83 - 49.15) * 1.5 = 88.35 < 133.71$

        $Q1_1 = 50$, $Q3_1 = 64.24 \approx 65$

        $Q1_1 = 49.15$, $Q3_1 = 64.83 \approx 65$

        \item
        We can conclude that the two distributions are approximately symmetric and that males tend to be older than females.

        $mean_1 - median_1 = 40.45 - 41 \approx 0$

        $mean_2 - median_2 = 37.24 - 36 \approx 0$

        $mean_1 = 40.45 > mean_2 = 37.24$, $median_1 = 41 > median_2 = 36$
    \end{enumerate}
\item
The distribution is right-skewed since the mean (17.02083 fatal accidents) was greater than the median (13.5 fatal accidents),
the bottom 50\% quantile of the box plot is much shorter in length than the upper 50\% quantile, and because there are two outliers 
(Greenville and Horry) that had 51 and 60 accidents, respectively. These two counties are outliers because they are greater than 1.5 * IQR plus Q3.

We observed counties with 0 accidents. This could be due to lack of data or a mistake since the “counties” with 
0 accidents are labeled as “Other” and “Unknown” which are not actual county names. This may suggest errors or unlabeled data.

The greater number of motorcycle accidents could be caused by 
higher population densities increasing traffic congestion, higher speed limits, or
a younger age distribution which is correlated with risky behavior.
