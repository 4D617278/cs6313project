    \begin{enumerate}
        \item
        Since the 95\% confidence interval contains 0, we accept the null hypothesis (males and females do not differ in body temperature). There does not appear to be a significant difference between male and female body temperatures.
        \item
        Since the 95\% confidence interval contains 0, we accept the null hypothesis (males and females do not differ in heart rate). There does not appear to be a significant difference between male and female heart rates.
        \item
        Since the correlation coefficient is 0.2536564, there is a weak positive linear relationship between body temperature and heart rate.

        This relationship does not seem to depend on gender since the intercepts and slopes of the models predicted by linear regression are approximately the same.
