    \begin{enumerate}
        \item
        Since the 95\% confidence interval contains 0, we accept the null hypothesis (males and females do not differ in body temperature). There does not appear to be a significant difference between male and female body temperatures.
        \item
        Since the 95\% confidence interval contains 0, we accept the null hypothesis (males and females do not differ in heart rate). There does not appear to be a significant difference between male and female heart rates.
        \item
        Since the correlation coefficient is 0.2536564, there is a weak positive linear relationship between body temperature and heart rate.

        This relationship does depend on gender since the correlation coefficients are different for males and females.
